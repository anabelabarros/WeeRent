# WeeRent

WeeRent is an innovative app based on the Airbnb concept, designed for renting out extra baby items you have at home. Instead of letting these items gather dust in storage, you can earn money by renting them out to other families in need. Built with Ruby on Rails, WeeRent aims to promote sustainability by recycling gently used baby products.
